Anomaly Detection Methods 

I am trying to get case of Animalies.

Measurement or input error.
Data corruption.
True outlier observation.
An outlier is an observation that is unlike the other observations. It is rare, or distinct, or does not fit in some way. It is also called anomalies.Â¶

Outlier can be of two types: 1) Univariate 2) Multivariate.

Univariate outliers can be found when we look at distribution of a single variable. Multi-variate outliers are outliers in an n-dimensional space. In order to find them, you have to look at distributions in multi-dimensions.
